# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network-project

• Explored Neural Networks and implemented it solve a linear Regression problem with 4+ hyperparamters
Learning rate, Batch size, Epochs, Optimizers,Activation functions
• Performed Data Augmentation using Image Data Generator class in Keras’ image preprocessing package
• Utilized pre-trained VGG-19 CNN Model for Multi-class image classification on FMINST dataset
• Designed Graphical User Interface to test the Image classification model with help of Tkinter library
